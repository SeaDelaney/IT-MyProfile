<h3>Background Info:</h3>
I'm an Australian born student. Ever since finishing school I've studied various topics relating to digital media at several other universities and TAFE to no avail. Like most other students I imagine studying IT and programming, I am also a avid video game player but also spend some of my off time playing tennis which I have played for around 8 years still

<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<h3>My interest in IT:</h3>
<p>My interest in IT studies has always been one that I have been passionate about since I was of a younger age. I always spent a lot of time around computers and vide games growing up, and still spend a lot of my free time playing games, fiddling with hardware and writing code for programs. I have studied ICT during high school and have looked at several game creation platforms such as unreal and blender to make models.</p>
<h3>Why I chose RMIT:</h3>
<p>I spent a long time looking around at different universities, reviews and what sites such as open universities had to say about what RMIT was like. through research I found many important things. The most import to me in particular though was the fact of how many IT and programming graduates are able to find suitable work when finishing as the RMIT IT courses are very well known.</p>
<h3>What do I expect to learn:</h3>
<p>I hope to learn the ability, not just in this subject, but in my entire years of studies to be able to learn how to fully develop most types of code from website and game development. Also learning the inner workings of IT departments and development. Before I started studying I was just happy to work in a simple IT department or a IT store but now that I have started studying and I have friends who are studying the same thing, I hope to one day be able to develop something with them</p>
