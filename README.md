<h3>Background Info:</h3>
I'm an Australian born student. Ever since finishing school I've studied various topics relating to digital media at several other universities and TAFE to no avail. Like most other students I imagine studying IT and programming, I am also a avid video game player but also spend some of my off time playing tennis which I have played for around 8 years still
